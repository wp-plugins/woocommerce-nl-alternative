> This plugin requires the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/">WooCommerce plugin</a>.

It is an alternative to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-nl/">WooCommerce (nl) plugin</a> which uses the formal 'u' form.
This plugin uses the informal 'je' form.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your
WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from the Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are my Checkout and Shop pages not translated? =

When this plugin is activated upon installation of WooCommerce, it will make those pages with Dutch names.
If you activated and did setup WooCommerce without this translation activated, you will have to rename
the title of those pages yourself manually.
